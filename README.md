# Binary Tree

This project focuses on implementing and working with the binary tree data structure. A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

## Project Overview

The project is organized into several files, each serving a specific purpose in managing and manipulating binary trees. Key aspects of the project include:

### File Structure

- `binary_trees.h`: Header file containing the necessary structures and function prototypes for working with binary trees.
- `0-binary_tree_node.c`: Implementation of a function to create a new binary tree node.
- `1-binary_tree_insert_left.c`: Function to insert a node as the left child of another node.
- `2-binary_tree_insert_right.c`: Function to insert a node as the right child of another node.
- `3-binary_tree_delete.c`: Function to delete an entire binary tree.
- `4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c`: Function to check if a node is a leaf.
- `5-binary_tree_is_root.c`: Function to check if a node is a root.
- `6-binary_tree_preorder.c`: Function to traverse a binary tree using pre-order traversal.
- `7-binary_tree_inorder.c`: Function to traverse a binary tree using in-order traversal.
- `8-binary_tree_postorder.c`: Function to traverse a binary tree using post-order traversal.
- `9-binary_tree_height.c`: Function to measure the height of a binary tree.
- `10-binary_tree_depth.c`: Function to measure the depth of a node in a binary tree.
- `11-binary_tree_size.c`: Function to measure the size of a binary tree.
- `12-binary_tree_leaves.c`: Function to count the leaves in a binary tree.
- `13-binary_tree_nodes.c`: Function to count the nodes with at least 1 child in a binary tree.
- `14-binary_tree_balance.c`: Function to measure the balance factor of a binary tree.
- `15-binary_tree_is_full.c`: Function to check if a binary tree is full.
- `16-binary_tree_is_perfect.c`: Function to check if a binary tree is perfect.
- `17-binary_tree_sibling.c`: Function to find the sibling of a node.
- `18-binary_tree_uncle.c`: Function to find the uncle of a node.
- `binary_tree_print.c`: Helper functions for printing binary trees.

### Data Structures

The project defines several data structures for different types of binary trees, including basic binary trees, binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, and Max Binary Heaps.

### Testing

The `main.c` files provided in the examples serve as a testing ground for the implemented functions.

## Conclusion

This Binary Tree project provides a foundation for understanding and working with binary trees.
